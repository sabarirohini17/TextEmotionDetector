# Text Emotion Detection

This repository contains a machine learning model to detect emotions in text. The model predicts emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, and fear based on input text. The system can be used for customer sentiment analysis, mental health monitoring, and social media feedback.

## Features
- Predicts multiple emotions from text data
- Pretrained model using a large labeled dataset
- Integrated into a simple web application for user-friendly interaction

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for deep learning models)
- Flask / Streamlit (for deployment)

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To run the emotion detection application:
```bash
python app.py
```

## Training the Model

If you want to retrain the model using your own data:
1. Add your dataset to the `data/` folder.
2. Run the training script:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

## Deployment

the model as a web app using Streamlit:

streamlit run app.py
